Data Scientist, Physics Ph.D., Educator, Delivering Data-driven Solutions

I am a physics Ph.D. who loves using data to find solutions to problems. I built a data pipeline that performed cleaning, quality checks, and analysis in Python to conduct sensitivity analysis on a large data set. As an educator, I have 5+ years experience translating technical concepts to broad audiences. Bridging the gap between the technical ideas and the action items is natural to me. I enjoy identifying inefficiencies and implementing technologies to help teams run smoother.
